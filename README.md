# VR-Wheelchair
This is the code written for a project which turned a wheelchair into a digital controller for a VR navigation environment. 

The code allowed a user to progress through a VR world written in Unity. The Arduino Device was an Arduino 2560 Mega with AdaFruit_BlueFruit LE NRF51 Shield to connect to rotary encoders attached to the Wheelchair. The code helps output a steady stream of Right or Left or Fwd or Bck instructions by listening to the difference in speed between the 2 wheels.
